Keyboard handler was taking 2 inputs as a time.

We were not taking the data when a key was being released. We added that for the keyboard handler.

Paging was causing other things to go all over the place, by causing random exceptions.
Shanay
Saurav
We had to step through paging and see what was causing the problem, we were not flushing the TLB correctly.

RTC was not being able to exit function properly, it kept page faulting

We have to do IRET at end of interrupt handler instead of ret because a couple flags are put on stack when we go into interrupt handler

Keyboard was spewing random characters out when we released the key
Soumitri
Soumitri/Shanay
We need to check for the release scancode being hit so that we can only print  out when the release scancode is not given in

Not being able to backspace correctly, it would backspace but not remove that character form the screen.

Page faulting when trying to use system call linkage
Vib

We were not declaring the assembly function correctly.

Not being able to halt system calls correctly.
Vib
Shanay
TSS was not being set correctly in halt system call

Page faulting when trying to return from read system call.
Vib

We had a buffer on the stack which was overflowing and causing the memory of read to be corrupted.

Halt needs to check if an exception flag was raised by user level code in order to return the proper value (256) and halt correctly.
Ian
Ian 
Instead of using a global variable, we used a setter and getter function in exception handler that would be set when an exception is called, then halt calls this to see if an exception was ever raised.

Fish was terminating abnormally
Adam
Saurav
When more than one data block is being read in, we are not reading the data block and are re-reading the old one, so we had to find the respective datablock and read it.

Pingpong speed was too fast
Jesse
Soumitri
We needed to keep the loop in rtc_read only when interrupt handler was not called yet. We did it the opposite way.
